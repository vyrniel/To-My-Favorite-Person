            <h2>Where We Are Now</h2>
            <p>You're my girlfriend. My favorite person. The one I feel safest with.</p>
            <p>I'm writing this not because you were missing, but because you're here. Because some connections don't start loudly, but they grow strong enough to last.</p>
            <p>This is the story of how we got here. Not perfect. Not cinematic. Just real.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Night I Remembered</h2>
            <p>It was years ago. A quiet night. I was alone, scrolling through Instagram, half distracted by nothing in particular.</p>
            <p>A friend sent me a screenshot of a conversation he'd had with someone. When I saw the name Khushi, something stirred. A pull I couldn't place.</p>
            <p>Familiarity before understanding.</p>
            <p>I searched the name. Her profile appeared. Then her photo.</p>
            <p>The recognition was immediate and silent. Not longing. Recognition.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Sixth Grade</h2>
            <p>We were in the same school during sixth grade. I rarely attended then. Most days I found reasons not to go.</p>
            <p>One morning on the bus, a friend mentioned a new girl named Khushi. I barely registered it.</p>
            <p>Later that day, during break, I saw her on the school ground. She was standing with her friends, smiling naturally at something one of them said.</p>
            <p>I didn't talk to her. I didn't know her personally. There was no introduction. No shared glance. No interaction at all.</p>
            <p>But the noise faded briefly. The moment felt unusually calm.</p>
            <p>It passed. But it stayed.</p>
            <p>This wasn't love. It wasn't a beginning. Just a moment quietly remembered.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Time Passing</h2>
            <p>I left that school not long after. Changed environments. Grew up unevenly.</p>
            <p>Life became heavy. Confusing. Directionless at times. Some years felt like static. Others felt like waiting for something I couldn't name.</p>
            <p>But the memory of her remained untouched. Not obsessed over. Just preserved.</p>
            <p>Quiet. Unchanged. There.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Finding You Again</h2>
            <p>That night, years later, when your name reappeared on my screen, the recognition became clear.</p>
            <p>I understood why that memory stayed. Why it never faded when so much else did.</p>
            <p>It wasn't dramatic. It was grounding. Like finding something I didn't know I'd been carrying.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>The Messy Middle</h2>
            <p>I wasn't perfect when we reconnected. I made mistakes.</p>
            <p>There was jealousy. Fear of losing something I hadn't earned yet. Actions driven by insecurity that I'm not proud of.</p>
            <p>I don't justify them. I own them.</p>
            <p>Growth doesn't come from pretending those moments didn't happen. It comes from acknowledging them and choosing differently.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>How We Actually Began</h2>
            <p>Conversation started slowly. Casually. Without force.</p>
            <p>We talked about small things first. Then bigger ones. There was no performance. No trying too hard.</p>
            <p>Friendship came first. Ease. Comfort.</p>
            <p>It felt human. Not scripted. Not cinematic.</p>
            <p>Just real.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Who You Are to Me Now</h2>
            <p>You're my girlfriend. The person I choose every day.</p>
            <p>You bring calm instead of chaos. You make silence feel safe instead of heavy.</p>
            <p>You don't fix things. You don't need to. You're just there, and that matters more than I know how to explain.</p>
            <p>This isn't about fate. It's about choice. And I choose you.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="final-section">
            <h2>New Year</h2>

                <p>The past happened. It shaped us. But it doesn't trap us.</p>
                <p>I'm grateful for the present. For this. For you.</p>
                <p>The future isn't certain. I don't pretend to know what it holds. But I know I want to walk toward it with you.</p>
                <p>Not because the story started perfectly. Because we're writing it together now.</p>
